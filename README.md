# LibQSQL
## A lightweight c++/Qt library aims to provide some convinent methods to access SQL in Qt programs.
    All you have to do is to simply bring LibQSql.h and LibQSql.cpp into your project,
    and create a LibQSQL object from namespace: L_library.
## This early version(v1.0 2022/8/30) provides with only a simple class that supports QSQLITE.
## If there is any bug,please inform me.
